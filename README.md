## Linear Regression Implementation From Scratch
Code implements linear regression from scratch in python.
Uses **numpy** for Scientific calculation &
**matplotlib** for Plotting the Graph.

Implements single feature linear regression on data.
Sample Dataset Used is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression/data)

## Logistics Regression Implementation From Scratch
Code implements Logistics regression from scratch for multiple Feature.
Dataset used is from Scikit Learn Library -> **Breast Cancer Dataset**
Feature Normalisation is applied on data
It Gets 98% right answer on Test Set.

## SVM from scratch
Code implements SVM with stochastic gradient descent with Multiple features.
Dataset used is like an example.
Main Model returns Modified weights
Inspired from Siraj Raval's Video.
